# Telco.Customer-Churn.Prediction
📊 Telco Customer Churn Prediction
🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecom industry. This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on customer demographics, account information, and service usage patterns using Machine Learning.

By identifying high-risk customers early, telecom companies can take proactive retention actions and reduce revenue loss.

🔍 Key Highlights

1) Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover churn patterns

2) Applied data preprocessing & feature encoding

3) Built and evaluated multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)

4) Performed hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance

5) Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score & ROC-AUC

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

📌 Outcome

The final model effectively predicts customer churn and provides insights that can support data-driven retention strategies.
